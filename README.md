## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GitHub Personal Access Token
- Repository URL and PR number you want to analyze

### How to Get GitHub Token
1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name and select scopes:
   - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - `read:org` (Read org and team membership)
4. Click "Generate token"
5. Copy the token (starts with `ghp_`)

## üìñ How to Use

### 1. **Dashboard** 
View overall statistics and metrics:
- Total PRs analyzed
- Total suggestions generated
- Security issues found
- Average quality score
- Quality metrics trends over time

### 2. **Analyze PR**
Submit a new pull request for analysis:
1. Enter the GitHub repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo`)
2. Enter the PR number (e.g., `123`)
3. Enter your GitHub Personal Access Token
4. Click "Analyze Pull Request"
5. Wait for AI analysis to complete (usually 30-60 seconds)

### 3. **Reviews**
View all completed code reviews:
- See all analyzed pull requests
- View summary statistics for each review
- Click on any review to see detailed analysis

### 4. **Review Details**
Deep dive into specific review:
- **Quality Scores**: Overall score, complexity, and maintainability
- **Code Suggestions**: Categorized by severity and type
- **Security Issues**: Critical vulnerabilities with recommendations

### 5. **Security**
View all security issues across all reviews

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI + Python)
- **AI Engine**: Uses GPT-4 via Emergent LLM Key for code analysis
- **GitHub Integration**: PyGithub library for PR fetching
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing reviews and metrics
